        <h1>Web Workshop #003 - Hybrid Mobile Application Development and the MEAN Stack</h1>
        <h2>About</h2>
        
        <div>
            <p>“Web Workshop” is a monthly meet-up of people, of all skill levels and specialities, interested in web development and web technologies. The format is a little different from your typical tech meet-up, with a short introductory talk about the subject followed by a longer hands on practical workshop taking you through the nuts and bolts of the new and exciting technology and creating your very own “Wonderthing” ™ out of it.</p>
            <p>This is a great chance to learn new skills and pick up pro-tips from new and seasoned developers alike. You will get your hands on and up to speed with new and emerging technologies.</p>
            <h2>MEAN</h2>
            <p>This month Paul Sutherland will be taking you through MEAN full-stack JavaScript Web and Mobile application development.</p>
            <script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="ef707d8082f10132a7cb1ade27531f87" data-ratio="1.77777777777778" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>
            <p>MEAN web development is a collection of tools for developing Web Apps, Mobile Apps and Websites using JavaScript as the programming language on both the front-end and the back-end (aka Full-stack).</p>
            <p>In this workshop I will take you through setting up your development environment, from setting up a version control system, discuss the history of JavaScript the programming language and show you the best of the resources available for future study. We will then dive into the MEAN stack which is NodeJS, MongoDB, AngularJS and ExpressJS.</p>
            <p>We will work through setting the stack up and get your first responsive MEAN application ready for world domination.</p>
            <p>We will then move onto developing Hybrid Mobile Apps using the MEAN stack, before discussing and reviewing how we can mange the distribution of your apps in the Enterprise environment, before looking at the latest technology available for building REST Apis.</p>
            <p>There will be a lot to cover, but don’t worry if you have absolutely no experience as this workshop is for both novice and professional. There will be a wide range of experienced people, from novice to guru, who will help you get up and running and get your first applications in place.</p>
            <p>We look forward to seeing you in our new location in the Vision building in Dundee.</p>
