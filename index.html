        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>"Web Workshop" is a monthly meet-up of people, of all skill levels and specialities, interested in web development and web technologies. The format is a little different from your typical tech meet-up, with a short introductory talk about the subject followed by a longer hands on practical workshop taking you through the nuts and bolts of the new and exciting technology and creating your very own "Wonderthing" &#8482; out of it.</p>

        <p>This is a great chance to learn new skills and pick up pro-tips from new and seasoned developers alike. You will get your hands on and up to speed with new and emerging technologies.</p>

        <p>Web Workshops are held at <a href="https://www.dundeemakerspace.co.uk/">Dundee MakerSpace</a> on the third Tuesday of the month.</p>
