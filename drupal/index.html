        <h2>About</h2>
        
        <div>
            <p>“Web Workshop” is a monthly meet-up of people, of all skill levels and specialities, interested in web development and web technologies. The format is a little different from your typical tech meet-up, with a short introductory talk about the subject followed by a longer hands on practical workshop taking you through the nuts and bolts of the new and exciting technology and creating your very own “Wonderthing” ™ out of it.</p>
            <p>This is a great chance to learn new skills and pick up pro-tips from new and seasoned developers alike. You will get your hands on and up to speed with new and emerging technologies.</p>
            <h2>Drupal</h2>
            <p>This month we are delighted to welcome John Hume from Drupal Scotland will bring us up to speed on what Drupal is, where it is going and how we can get started using it.  There will be a workshop following the talk where we will get you up to speed and installing Drupal ready for use in your projects or within your organisation.</p>
            <p>There will be a lot to cover, but don’t worry if you have absolutely no experience as this workshop is for both novice and professional.  There will be a wide range of experienced people, from novice to guru, who will help you get up and running and get your first Drupal site in place.</p>
            <p>Pre-requisites for the workshop are to have a LAMP or equivalent stack installed.  So for Windows please install <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wampserver/">WAMP</a>, for MAC please install <a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/">MAMP</a> and for Linux, setup a LAMP stack from your distribution’s repository.</p>
            <p>We look forward to seeing you in our new location in the Vision building in Dundee.</p>
