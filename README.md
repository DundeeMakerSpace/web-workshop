About
=====

“Web Workshop” is a monthly meet-up of people, of all skill levels and specialities, interested in web development and web technologies. The format is a little different from your typical tech meet-up, with a short introductory talk about the subject followed by a longer hands on practical workshop taking you through the nuts and bolts of the new and exciting technology and creating your very own “Wonderthing” ™ out of it.

This is a great chance to learn new skills and pick up pro-tips from new and seasoned developers alike. You will get your hands on and up to speed with new and emerging technologies.
