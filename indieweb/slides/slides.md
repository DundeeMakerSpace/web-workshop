## IndieWeb


### Independant

Note: You should all know about this. Making & publishing by yourself


### Web


### You!

Note: It's all about doing something for your own needs



## The IndieWeb Priciples

Note: All from http://indiewebcamp.com/Principles for more info


### Own your data.


### Use visible data for humans first, machines second.


### Build tools for yourself, not for all of your friends.

Note: It's extremely hard to fight Metcalfe's law: you won't be able to convince all your friends to join the independent web. But if you build something that satisfies your own needs, but is backwards compatible for people who haven't joined in (say, by practicing POSSE), the time and effort you've spent building your own tools isn't wasted just because others haven't joined in yet.


### Eat your own dogfood.

Note: Whatever you build should be for yourself. If you aren't depending on it, why should anybody else? We call that selfdogfooding. More importantly, build the indieweb around your needs. If you design tools for some hypothetical user, they may not actually exist; if you build tools for yourself, you actually do exist. selfdogfooding is also a form of "proof of work" to help focus on productive interactions.


### Document your stuff.

Note: You've built a place to speak your mind, use it to document your processes, ideas, designs and code. At least document it for your future self.


### Open source your stuff!

Note: You don't have to, of course, but if you like the existence of the indie web, making your code open source means other people can get on the indie web quicker and easier.


### UX and design is more important than protocols.

Note: We focus on UX first, and then as we figure that out we build/develop/subset the absolutely simplest most minimal protocols sufficient to support that UX, and nothing more.


### Build platform agnostic platforms. 

Note: The more your code is modular and composed of pieces you can swap out, the less dependent you are on a particular device, UI, templating language, API, backend language, storage model, database, platform. The more your code is modular, the greater the chance that at least some of it can and will be re-used, improved, which you can then reincorporate.


### Longevity.

Note: Build for the long web. If human society is are able to preserve ancient papyrus, Victorian photographs and dinosaur bones, we should be able to build web technology that doesn't require us to destroy everything we've done every few years in the name of progress.


### Have fun.

Note: Remember that GeoCities page you built back in the mid-90s? The one with the Java applets, garish green background and seventeen animated GIFs? It may have been ugly, badly coded and sucky, but it was fun, damnit. Keep the web weird and interesting.



## What to do this evening?

Note: There are plenty of people who will be able to help you


### Get your own domain

Note: This is your home. Your domain is your identity on the IndieWeb. Domains are unique and ubiquitous


### Get some hosting


### Set up your identity

#### h-card & social accounts

#### [IndieAuth](https://indieauth.com/)

Note: 
- IndieAuth is a way to log into sites using your domain name
- It finds your h-card and links to your social networks
- It then checks your social networks for a link to your domain
- You can then log in via a social network
- Sounds advanced but this is just html and settings


### Publish on your own site

Note:
- This is where it starts to get technical
- This is probably the biggest step
- Hundreds of ways to do this: CMS, DIY, pre-built


### Microformat all the things

Note: 
- Microformats is a way of marking up html for computer parsing
- Required for a lot of IndieWeb technologies


### POSSE <br><small>Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere</small>

Note: 
- Push your content to Twitter, FB, etc
- Take control back from silos


### PESOS <br><small>Publish Elsewhere, Syndicate (to your) Own Site</small>

Note: 
- Some services are hard to publish from your own site
- Might be easier to pull the data in

### Webmentions

Note: A way of replying to urls from your own website


### Micropub

Note:
- A set api structure for publishing to your own site
- Allows things like "share on your site" buttons to work in the future



## Where to get more info


### IndieWebCamp <br> <small>(disambiguation)</small>

Note: IndieWebCamp is a regular event and also the home to all things IndieWeb at this moment in time.


### [The IRC channel](http://indiewebcamp.com/IRC)

Note: Very friendly and not too busy but usually someone there
